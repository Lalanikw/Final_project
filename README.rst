Prblem Scenarios:
===============

How to assign leads to that comes to the internet department: On daily
basis, the car dealership receives from customers who want to get 
information about the cars at the car dealership. The problem Thanooj
faces is how to allocate these inquiries among different sale personals. 

Current mechanism: All sales inquiries come to Thonooj, and he assigns
these to different sales associates. The situation has become a very
difficult task for Thanooj as he has to monitor the system/ emails 
constantly even n his day off. He further has to monitor if the sales 
associate has responded within a given time. The situation has ended 
up a Thanooj responses to most of the inquiries by himself.
